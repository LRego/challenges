## Description

Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.

Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.

He answers 'Woah, chill out!' if you yell at him.

He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying anything.

He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.

## Examples

* "How are you?" -> "Sure."
* "WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING?" -> "Woah, chill out!"
* "" -> "Fine. Be that way!"
* "Hello." -> "Whatever."
* "1, 2, 3" -> "Whatever."
* "1, 2, 3 GO!" -> "Woah, chill out!"
* "    " -> "Fine. Be that way!"
